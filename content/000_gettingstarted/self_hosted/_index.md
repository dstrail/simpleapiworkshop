To use API Gateway and other AWS services, you need an AWS account. If you don't have an account, visit [**aws.amazon.com**](https://aws.amazon.com/) and choose Create an AWS Account. For detailed instructions, see [**Create and activate an AWS account**](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).

As a best practice, you should also create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user with administrator permissions and use that for all work that does not require root credentials. Create a password for console access, and access keys to use command line tools. See Creating your first IAM admin user and group in the IAM User Guide for instructions. 

Once you have completed the step above, you can head straight to [**Create a DynamoDB table**](/020_createadynamodbtable/)
