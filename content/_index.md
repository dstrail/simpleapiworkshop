In this workshop you will create an API that creates, reads updates and deletes items from a DynamoDB table. The API will run serverless, so there is no management of the underlying infrastructure and scaling is done automatically. 

You will learn how easy it is to create an API on AWS, all within 45 minutes. 

The workshop features the creation of a DynamoDB table, HTTP API Gateway, Lambda function, and an AWS Cloud9 IDE.
