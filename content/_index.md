In this workshop we will create an API that creates, reads updates and deletes from a DynamoDB table. The API will run serverless, so there is no management of the underlying infrastructure and scaling is done automatically. 

We will learn how easy it is to create an API on AWS, all within 45 minutes. 

The workshop features the creation of the following resources: 

- DynamoDB table
- API Gateway
- Lambda function
